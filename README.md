Brief description of project: A multi-section, accessible webpage for a fictious company named "Acessibility Design Co."
HTML and CSS are used to create this webpage. Open this the index file to view the webpage, the accompanying
CSS file should load. 


1.) What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them? 

The main challenges I faced were ensuring that the elements of the page adjusted according to the screen size
and finding colors that were readable. Other challenges were ensuring proper labeling for form inputs 
and figuring out the semantic structure for screen readers. I wrote media queries, using the color tool
that was provided to us and added label elements and alt text to make it more accessible. I was not successul
with the screen size adjustment and ran out of time.

2.) How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?

To ensure the design was responsive and accessible, I attempted to use Flexbox and CSS grid
to allow the layout to adjust dynamically. I used media queries as well to allow content to remain
readable on smaller devices. For accessibility, I attempted to keep a clear structure to my page,
meaningful alt text to appropriate images, label elements with the form input and the role="navigation"
for helping assistive technologies. I added hovers styles to buttons to make them more visible for users
with screen readers.
